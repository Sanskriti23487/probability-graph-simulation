Quantitative Probability Simulation & Statistical Modeling

This project provides a robust Python-based framework for simulating fundamental probability distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial) and illustrating key statistical phenomena. It is designed to offer practical insights into probabilistic modeling, especially relevant for quantitative finance, data science, and statistical analysis.

Core Features
Configurable Bernoulli Experiment Simulator
Implements a BernoulliExperiment module to simulate independent trials with customizable parameters such as:

Success probability (p)

Number of trials (n)

Number of experiment repetitions
Also supports custom profit/loss mappings, making it useful for financial scenario modeling.

Binomial Distribution Analysis
Analyzes and visualizes the outcome frequencies for Binomial random variables.

Generates histograms for raw and normalized values

Approximates the Probability Mass Function (PMF) for statistical insight

Poisson Distribution Convergence
Demonstrates the mathematical convergence of the Binomial PMF to the Poisson PMF as n → ∞ and np remains constant.
This is critical for modeling rare events and stochastic processes in continuous-time systems.

Technologies Used
Python – Core implementation language

NumPy – High-performance numerical operations and array computations

Matplotlib – Data visualization and statistical plotting
